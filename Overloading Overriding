Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters (i.e., method signature). 
One of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class.
Overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided its parent class.

1). The real object type in the run-time, not the reference variable's type, 
determines which overridden method is used at runtime. In contrast, reference type determines which overloaded
method will be used at compile time.
2). Polymorphism applies to overriding, not to overloading.
3). Overriding is a run-time concept while overloading is a compile-time concept.
